'''
    Method to generate a point mask from one image.
    The method will generate 10 lines all with distinct angles. 
    This means that each line will segment the board according to the 
    point reagions of the board as these are the most distinguished lines.
    The image must not have lines that are more distinct than the point region lines.

    Parametres
    -----------
    image
        the image to generate lines from

    -----------
    return
        the same image as the parametre but with added lines.
